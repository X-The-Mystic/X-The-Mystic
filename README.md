Hello, I'm X the Mystic.
If you want to contact me or something, do so through at </XtM>@cerberusdev.com.
I may or may not respond.

My Code and Stuff.
I'm busy on exploit development and cybersecurity compromization.
I've been working mostly on a collection of modern redteam tools called Ex Machina.
Oh, and I have been developing a LLM translation machine.

Have a good terrestrial rotation.
