Hello, I'm X the Mystic.

I'm interested in seq2seq deep learning, exploit development and control, and developing information traffic control, or, as I like to call it "complete dominion of all those lusers".

I'm working on a new style of IPv4 communication called Absolute-Zero. It uses the `ping` function to transmit large amounts of data across a network.
I'm also working on a metasploit-esque redteam tool called "Scrapbook". If you want to contribute, please contact me.

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to see me through my Replit account, or on Slack.

Thanks for stalking me today!
