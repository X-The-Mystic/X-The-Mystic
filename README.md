Hello, I'm X the Mystic, but you can call me cerberus. 

I'm interested in seq2seq deep learning, developing information traffic control, and data analysis. 

I've been working on my DDoS attack sequence, and you can check out my current magnum opus at `https://github.com/X-The-Mystic/DDoS-9`.

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to see me through my Replit account, or at casparrampacek@gmail.com.
