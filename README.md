Hello, I'm X the Mystic.

My Interests:

I'm interested in seq2seq deep learning, and developing information traffic control, or, as I like to call it "complete dominion of all those lusers".

I'm working on a new style of IPv4 communication called Absolute-Zero. It uses the `ping` function to transmit large amounts of data across a network. 

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to see me through my Replit account.

Thanks for stalking me today!
