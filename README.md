Hello, I'm X the Mystic.
----

#My Interests:
I'm interested in seq2seq deep learning, developing information traffic control, and data analysis. 

#What I'm working on:
I'm working on a new style of IPv4 communication called Absolute-Zero. It uses the `ping` function to transmit large amounts of data across a network. 

If you'd like to contact me, please feel free to see me through my Replit account, or at casparrampacek@gmail.com.
